Create stack.py module.
Expose only stack APIs (LIFO):
- push - adds item on top of stack,
- pop  - removes item from top of stack,
- top  - gets top item without removal,
- is_empty - boolean whether stack is empty.

in main.py create a function which gets a stack with a series of alphabetic characters, with @ inside.
Your mission is to shrink the stack so between each @ the maximum chars are left.

Example for such a stack:
 t
 a
 x
 @
 m
 @
 g
 r
 b

|  |

\  /

 x
 @
 m
 @
 r

*Note: In this ex you can use only your stacks, and only the noted APIs!
*Note: If I send you my_stack, then I shall see your changes in my_stack after your function.
