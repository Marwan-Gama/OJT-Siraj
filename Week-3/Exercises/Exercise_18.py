'''
• A Mersenne prime, Mi, is a prime number of the form Mi = 2i -1
• Mersenne primes are noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers
• All even perfect numbers have the form 2p - 1(2p - 1) where 2p - 1 is prime
• The set of Mersenne primes less than or equal to n may be thought of as the intersection of the set of all
primes less than or equal to n, Pn, with the set, An, of integers satisfying 2i -1 <= n
• Write a program that prints the list of the Mersenne primes less than 1,000,000
• Hint: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes (Sieve of Eratosthenes -Wikipedia) method to find all primes less than or equal
to n.
