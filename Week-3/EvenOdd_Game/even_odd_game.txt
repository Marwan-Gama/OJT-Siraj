EvenOdd Game
-------------------------------
Create a console program called EvenOdd Game

Phase 1:
-----------------------------------
2 players play against each other.
You get the player's names from the user.
In each round, the game randomize a number between -5 and 13.
If the number is even, the first player gets a point.
If the number is odd, the second player gets a point.
Rounds are played until someone is the first to get 3 points (Best of 5), and when so - she's the winner.

For example:
Round #1, random number is 8, Julia scored!
Status: Julia 1, Avihu 0
Round #2, random number is 10, Julia scored!
Status: Julia 2, Avihu 0
Round #3, random number is 5, Avihu scored!
Status: Julia 2, Avihu 1
Round #4, random number is 12, Julia scored!
Status: Julia 3, Avihu 1
Julia Wins!


Phase 2:
-----------------------------------
Enhance the EvenOdd game:
Now enable to conduct a tournament.
You can get players from the user (no less than 2).
Now, in each round the game picks up 2 players randomly to play, so one of them will get a point.
The game is playing rounds (each round with 2 randomized players!) until someone reaches 3 wins:
If, for example, it's best of 5 - the first to get to 3 points.
If, for example, it's best of 7 - the first to get to 4 points.

phase 3:
-----------------------------------
The winner of the tournament should play against the Boss.
The Boss has special ability: if the number is negative even, the player doesn't get the point, and the round is replayed again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
- Player has at least name and score.
- Best of 5 can be dynamic (Can be set to 3/5/7/9..., so the number of points to win vary)
- Model your project! Split into functions and modules.
- Clean Coding!
