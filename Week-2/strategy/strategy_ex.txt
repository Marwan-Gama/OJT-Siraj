#Strategy pattern (simplified here) is the ability to inject code into specific places in an already made algorithm,


#Your mission (If you would like to accept it ;-)
#1- Complete the process body: process is the strategy, in which you send a list of items, then filter some, then do some manipulation on each, and finally do some action on each.
#2- Now use process like so: For a given list of numbers: For all numbers which are odd, between -400 and 100 and don't include 7, calculate their TAX


#Print all like so (For example, for a number like 215): The TAX is 251.55


#3- Now use process like so: For a given list of students (tuple with name, course, grade): For all students learning Python which have grades above 70, give 5% bonus


#Print all like so (For example, you have student named Eithan, learning Python with grade 80): Eithan's grade (80) is now 85
